# Initio
This is the personal starter theme I created and use when developing websites using WordPress and the Genesis Framework. This is a work in progress.

Github project link: https://github.com/jpmarchand/initio


## Installation Instructions

1. Upload the initio folder via FTP to your wp-content/themes/ directory. The Genesis parent theme needs to be in the wp-content/themes/ directory as well.
2. Go to your WordPress dashboard and select Appearance.
3. Activate the Initio theme.


## Theme Support

I do NOT provide any support for this theme.
